# Caerus
ðŸ‘¾ Awesome CHIP-8 emulator for iOS

Caerus is a CHIP-8 emulator built for iOS devices, allowing users to play classic CHIP-8 games seamlessly. Its name derives from the greek mythology, that being the personification of opportunity, luck and favorable moments. The iOS app is a frontend for my CHIP-8 emulator backend, Chippy, which accurately implements the CHIP-8 architecture and provides a simple interface to load and run games. Chippy also features a macOS / Linux frontend, internally referred to as Peppermint, which can be found at [https://github.com/0xilis/Chippy](https://github.com/0xilis/Chippy).

# Features

- Authentic Emulation: Accurate reproduction of CHIP-8 operations, including graphics rendering and input handling.
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive controls for easy gameplay.
- (PLANNED) Multi-Mode Support: Super Chip-48's 128x64 mode doubling resolution is supported.
- (PLANNED) Apple Archive Support: Caerus takes advantage of Apple's Apple Archive format and supports loading multiple games from .aar.

# Getting Started

To run the emulator, clone the repository, open in Xcode and change the SDL2 path to reflect your directory. Caerus does not include SDL2 source here, but it's unmodified from the current source, so you should not experience any issues. Then build, and you should be golden!
